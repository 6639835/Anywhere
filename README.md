# Anywhere

**The best native proxy client for iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS.**

A native, zero-dependency proxy client built entirely in Swift.
No Electron. No WebView. No sing-box wrapper. Pure protocol implementation from the ground up.

## Why Anywhere?

Most iOS proxy clients wrap sing-box or Xray-core in a Go/C++ bridge. Anywhere takes a different approach — every protocol, every transport, the QUIC stack, and the entire packet tunnel are implemented natively in Swift and C. The result is a smaller binary, lower memory usage, tighter system integration, and no bridging overhead.

## Features

### Highlights

- **Native core** — Swift 6 with strict concurrency, the native AnywhereIP TCP/IP stack, and vendored C for ngtcp2 and BLAKE3. No Go or C++ core, no bridging layer, no third-party networking packages. A single codebase builds the iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps, the packet tunnel, and the Control Center controls.
- **Native TLS stack** — TLS 1.2 and 1.3, client and server, implemented in Swift. Browser-exact ClientHello fingerprints for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge; Encrypted Client Hello from an inline configuration or from DNS HTTPS records; hybrid X25519 and ML-KEM key shares. The same stack terminates TLS for MITM and provides the handshake primitives for Reality.
- **Native QUIC stack** — ngtcp2 driven from Swift, with BBR, CUBIC, and Brutal congestion control, connection migration, DATAGRAM frames, session resumption, and pluggable packet obfuscation. One engine serves Hysteria2, Nowhere, and XHTTP over HTTP/3.
- **Multi-stage routing** — a five-tier matcher built from domain-suffix tries, keyword automata, and CIDR tries classifies each destination at DNS time through Fake-IP, at connect time before the TCP handshake is accepted, and again mid-connection from the sniffed TLS SNI. Bundled service, ad-block, and country-bypass rule sets are complemented by importable and subscribable `.arrs` rule sets.
- **Built-in MITM** — HTTPS is terminated with a generated root CA. HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 traffic is rewritten by declarative rules or JavaScript, HTTP/2 clients are bridged to HTTP/1.1 upstreams, and script-initiated HTTP requests are dialled through the tunnel's own routing.
- **Purify and DNS** — a QUIC policy that fails HTTP/3 fast so that routing and MITM act on HTTP/2, WebRTC and UDP blocking, DNS-leak prevention, and independent plain or DoH resolvers for proxy servers, IP rules, subscriptions, ECH, and fallback.
- **Platform integration** — a native Apple TV app, an Apple Watch companion, Control Center toggles for VPN and mode, and iCloud sync through CloudKit.
- **Engineered for the extension budget** — global buffer ledgers, connection caps, and pressure throttling keep the packet tunnel within the Network Extension memory limit. The tunnel stack, TCP connections, and MITM sessions are actors bound to a per-tunnel serial executor, so the packet path never changes threads.

### Protocols

| Protocol | Runs over | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nowhere** | TCP · UDP | Independent upload and download carriers over TLS or QUIC, paired per flow · Morph masking applied beneath TLS · credit-scheduled multiplexing over TLS · early data on flow open · UDP over QUIC DATAGRAM |
| **VLESS** | TCP · UDP | Post-quantum `mlkem768x25519plus` encryption with 0-RTT · XTLS-RPRX-Vision · Reality with browser fingerprints · WebSocket, HTTPUpgrade, gRPC, and XHTTP transports · XHTTP over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 with upload/download detach and XMUX pooling · XUDP |
| **Hysteria2** | UDP | Brutal congestion control with server-negotiated bandwidth, or BBR · Salamander and Gecko obfuscation, the latter splitting handshake packets · UDP over QUIC DATAGRAM with fragmentation |
| **Sudoku** | TCP | Payload encoded as Sudoku-grid hints with per-direction ASCII or entropy layouts and randomly selected custom tables · KIP X25519 handshake with session rekeying · HTTP masquerade in legacy, stream, poll, and WebSocket modes · pure-downlink mode · native multiplexing |
| **Trojan** | TCP | Authentication header carried in the first payload without an additional round trip · UDP relayed over the same TLS stream |
| **AnyTLS** | TCP | Server-driven padding scheme with ranges, checkpoints, and runtime updates · warm pool of idle TLS sessions shared across connections · heartbeat keepalive · UDP-over-TCP |
| **Shadowsocks** | TCP · UDP | Shadowsocks 2022 with BLAKE3 key derivation, replay protection, and multi-user identity headers, alongside classic AEAD ciphers · native UDP with shared multi-flow sessions |
| **SOCKS5** | TCP · UDP | Full UDP ASSOCIATE with a native datagram relay that follows the proxy chain · username / password authentication |
| **RFC** | TCP | `CONNECT` over HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, selected by ALPN · HTTP/2 multiplexes tunnels on a single TLS session with flow control and pooling · Basic authentication · plaintext or TLS |

- [MITM Rewrite System](Documentations/MITM.md) — developer guide to authoring TLS interception rule sets and `process(ctx)` scripts: the import format, rule operations, rewrite actions, and the full `Anywhere` scripting API.

## Deep Links

Anywhere registers several URL schemes so external apps and websites can trigger proxy import directly.

### `anywhere://` Scheme

```
anywhere://add-proxy?link=<link>
```

`<link>` can be any URL the app supports: a subscription URL, a `nowhere://` link, a `vless://` link, an `ss://` link, etc.

> **Note:** The `link` parameter is parsed by taking everything after `?link=` verbatim, so the inner URL does **not** need to be percent-encoded. For example, `anywhere://add-proxy?link=https://example.com/sub?token=abc&foo=bar` works as expected.

### Import Rule Sets

```
anywhere://add-rule-set?link=<arrs-or-amrs-url>&link=<arrs-or-amrs-url>
```

Import one or more routing (`.arrs`) and MITM (`.amrs`) rule sets from remote links. Pass one `link` query item per rule set; routing and MITM links may be mixed freely.

> **Note:** Unlike `add-proxy`, each `link` is a standard URL query item, so multiple links are supported. Percent-encode a link only if it carries its own reserved characters (`&`, `=`, `#`).

### Proxy URI Schemes

Tapping any of the following links on iOS will open Anywhere and pre-fill the full URI in the Add Proxy view for import:

`nowhere://` · `vless://` · `hysteria2://` (`hy2://`) · `sudoku://` · `trojan://` · `anytls://` · `ss://` · `socks5://` (`socks://`) · `rfc://`

### Integration Example

Link from a webpage:

```html
<a href="anywhere://add-proxy?link=https://example.com/subscription">Import Subscription</a>
```

Open from another iOS app:

```swift
if let url = URL(string: "anywhere://add-proxy?link=nowhere://key@host:443?up=udp&down=udp") {
    UIApplication.shared.open(url)
}
```

In addition to the GPLv3 obligations above, if you fork, build, or redistribute this project you **must remove or replace** the "Anywhere" and "Anywhere Proxy" names and the Anywhere app icon with your own branding before distribution. You may not publish a build under the "Anywhere" or "Anywhere Proxy" name, or carrying the Anywhere app icon, in any app store or elsewhere, in a way that could imply it is the official app or is endorsed by NodePassProject.
